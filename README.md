Webstorm settings for airbnb style guide

Since Webstorm doesn't extract the style guide from eslint, I ended up doing it manually with the Code Style settings (with some opinionated changes). 

This repo was a way for me to share the setting between different computers. See [Settings repository](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository).
